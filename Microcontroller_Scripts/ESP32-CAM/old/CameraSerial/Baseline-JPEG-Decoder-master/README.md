# Baseline JPEG Decoder

This repo contains the code for decoding a baseline encoded, YCrCb image using Python. The code is modified from Raul Aguaviva's MIT licensed [micro-jpeg-visualizer](https://github.com/aguaviva/micro-jpeg-visualizer) repo. I made some stuff more explicit for better understanding. This is highly unoptimized code so don't use it in any production project. I have written an article that explains this code-base in a step-by-step fashion. You can read it [on my blog](https://yasoob.me/posts/understanding-and-writing-jpeg-decoder-in-python/).
